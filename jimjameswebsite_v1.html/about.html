    <h5 class="w3-center">A Guitar Legend</h5>
    <p class="w3-large">As the vocalist, frontman, producer and lead songwriter for My Morning Jacket, James has been instrumental in defining the sound of the band. James typically plays rhythm guitar, acoustic guitar, and occasional lead guitar on My Morning Jacket songs. He played the role of the band leader in the Bob Dylan biopic I'm Not There, singing the song "Going to Acapulco", with Calexico as his backing band, which was featured on the soundtrack of the film. Rolling Stone listed James among their "20 New Guitar Gods" along with fellow My Morning Jacket guitarist Carl Broemel.</p>

    <h5 class="w3-center">Today</h5>
    <p class="w3-large">With My Morning Jacket on a semi-hiatus, frontman Jim James released two solo albums of the same material last year: “Uniform Distortion,” the electric rock version, and “Uniform Clarity,” an acoustic take. “It’s fun to play differently,” says James, who toured behind “Clarity” last year. While James is mostly on the road solo this year, My Morning Jacket will play three shows this summer before getting together in the fall to work on new material, he says.</p>
